# Hi, we're Dâ†’SH ðŸ‘‹

We're **Dâ†’SH**, an independent student-ran software startup that incorporates creativity and good vibes into what we create. We're a team of developers and designers dedicated to building quality, open-source products just for the fun of it. Our main mission is to eventually create a fresh, open-source project every month, hopefully building a portfolio of useful products while doing so. Currently, we're set on launching on **Feb 25, 2022** ðŸš€
